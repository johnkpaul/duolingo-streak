We have relied on donor milk for the past 8 months and just need to make it a little longer as he still is having around 30 oz a day as we try to get him to consume more solids and less milk. He won’t take formula and our stash of frozen milk is almost gone.  We are located in brooklyn and are willing to travel for milk. Will replace bags. Thank you for your consideration and for being a milk donor. ❤️6 Comments3 SharesShare‎Desirae Elaine Givhan‎ to Human Milk 4 Human Babies - New York · 14 hrs · I’m looking for milk for my 8 week old son.
